- **Distribute Issues**: Each Tuesday, we redistribute each issue. 
- **Labels**: The labels we use for Scrum: **PLANNED**, **DOING**, **DONE**, **REVIEWING**. 
- Each meeting has **Note taker** and **Chair**. Each Sprint has a different **Note taker** and **Chair** from the previous week. 

## Deadlines 
- [ ] 21 November 2021 - Finish Backlog 
- [ ] Lab 1 - End of Week 4 (4th December or 5th December)

## Code of Conduct 
- Work on features individually - No pair programming unless otherwise specified in Issue Description. 
- Commit your own code
- Branch for each feature. `master` and `develop` should be protected. 
- Do not push to other people's branches without consent 
- Take or give issues from others only **after** clear communication and consent on both sides. 
- Approve with merge requests only **after** reviewing the commits and adding comments/feedback. 
- Open merge requests for `develop` too, though it is possible to push directly. 
- Approve/Complete merge requests in a timely manner. Check the channel `#merge-requests` to see if any MRs still need approval. 

## Penalties 
- If you don't finish your issues by Sprint deadline (Tuesday), then your deadline will be that same week on Friday. If you don't finish by Friday, someone else will take your issue and you won't receive the points for that feature. 

## Questions for TA - Week 2 
- Can be found in separate document. Send the questions to TA before Thursday meeting. 
- Is there anything else we should include in this document too?
